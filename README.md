Grocery-Basket API

<h3> Grocery-Basket Overview </h3>
  <p> This API was written for the Grocery-Basket
<a href='https://jolavb.github.io/Grocery-Basket//'> Single Page Application.</a> I have developed this API and the Grocery Basket App out of my own frustration at reliably acessing and aggregating
on sale grocery items into recipies. The goal of Grocery-Basket is to allow
the collection and aggregation of on-sale grocery items from the greater boston area into cheap and delicious recipies. Food item and store html
data are collected weekly and stored in a postgres db running on heroku.</br></p>

   <p>The first version of Grocery-Basket allows a user to select a grocery store to display and add on-sale items to thier cart. Cart
items may be updated or deleted and a user may use the cart as a reference while shopping at thier local grocery store. </p>



<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
1. Ruby On Rails
2. Heroku
3. PostGres DB


<h3>To Do </h3>
1. Aggregate Ingredients into Recipies and store/serve from rails
3. Store cart history
4. Store user item quantities
